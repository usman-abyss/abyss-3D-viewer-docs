# PointsAttributeBuffer

## Description

The `PointsAttributeBuffer` class is used to store and manage point attribute data. It provides a way to efficiently encode and decode point attribute data into a texture format, which can then be used to render the points using WebGL shaders.

The class has the following properties:

- `maxId`: The maximum possible value of a point attribute.
- `numberPoints`: The number of points in the buffer.
- `textureSize`: The size of the texture used to store the point attribute data.
- `cardinality`: The number of texture coordinates used to encode each point attribute value.
- `data`: A Float32Array containing the point attribute data.

The class also has the following methods:

- `setValue()`: Sets the point attribute value for a given point.
- `getValue()`: Gets the point attribute value for a given point.
- `annotationIdToUV()`: Converts a point attribute value to a UV coordinate on the texture.
- `annotationIdToU()`: Converts a point attribute value to a single texture coordinate on the texture.
- `uToAnnotationId()`: Converts a texture coordinate to a point attribute value.
- `uvToAnnotationId()`: Converts a UV coordinate on the texture to a point attribute value.

The following is a simplified explanation of how the `PointsAttributeBuffer` class works:

The constructor creates a new buffer and initializes its properties.
The `setValue()` method is used to set the point attribute value for a given point. This method encodes the point attribute value into a UV coordinate on the texture.
The `getValue()` method is used to get the point attribute value for a given point. This method decodes the UV coordinate on the texture to get the point attribute value.
The `annotationIdToUV()`, `annotationIdToU()`, `uToAnnotationId()`, and `uvToAnnotationId()` methods are used to convert between point attribute values and UV coordinates on the texture.
The PointsAttributeBuffer class is a useful tool for efficiently rendering point attribute data in WebGL applications. It can be used to render points with different colors, sizes, and other attributes.

### maxId

The `maxId` is passed to the `calcTextureSize()` function in the constructor of the `PointsAttributeBuffer` class to calculate the texture size because the texture size is determined by the number of point attributes that need to be stored.

The `calcTextureSize()` function calculates the texture size based on the following rules:

- The texture width must be a power of 2.
- The texture height must be at least 1.
- The total number of pixels in the texture must be greater than or equal to the number of point attributes that need to be stored.

The `maxId` is used to calculate the number of point attributes that need to be stored. The `calcTextureSize()` function then calculates the texture size that meets the above rules.

For example, if the `maxId` is **1023**, then the `calcTextureSize()` function will return a texture size of **1024x1**. This is because **1024** is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than **1023**.

The constructor of the `PointsAttributeBuffer` class then creates a new Float32Array to store the point attribute data. The size of the Float32Array is equal to the number of points in the buffer multiplied by the cardinality of the texture.

The cardinality of the texture is the number of texture coordinates used to encode each point attribute value. For example, if the texture is a 1D texture, then the cardinality is 1. If the texture is a 2D texture, then the cardinality is 2.

The constructor of the `PointsAttributeBuffer` class then initializes the `textureSize` property to the texture size calculated by the `calcTextureSize()` function.

The `maxId` is passed to the `calcTextureSize()` function in the constructor of the `PointsAttributeBuffer` class to ensure that the texture size is large enough to store all of the point attribute data.

## Use cases

The `PointsAttributeBuffer` class can be used to implement a variety of features, such as:

- Coloring points based on their attribute values.
- Rendering points at different sizes based on their attribute values.
- Implementing a level-of-detail (LOD) system for the points.
- Implementing a color palette for the points.
